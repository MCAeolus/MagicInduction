# MagicInduction
Magic Induction, a Spigot Plugin involving magic wands and spells for Minecraft 1.12.
This was written for a three day contest where the theme was magic! Check the contest website here: http://plugindevelopmentcontest.pe.hu/

# Guide
Magic Induction uses no commands whatsoever, and depends on the user either having read up on it or through in game messages given to the player after completing parts of the plugin. In Magic Induction, you should start by making a _wand_. A wand is the primary tool used in this plugin. A wand is crafted with two sticks, a diamond, two gold ingots, and two iron ingots. Here is an image of what the recipe looks like: http://imgur.com/3Vssjxj

After crafting this wand, you need to empower it. You are given instructions in-game, but some more info will be given here.
As said in the in-game text, you need to place an iron block somewhere in the world in the middle of a semi-clear 5x5 space (tall grass/flowers/etc. dont matter but any blocks do). After placing this, drop the crafted wand on top of the block and right-click the iron block. This will create a 'ruin', which is simply a scar placed on the land by empowering the wand. This ruin serves no purpose afterwards. _It is noted these can also be created with an empowered wand that is using the No Focus state when right-clicking an iron block._ You now have an empowered wand! Congratulations. In order to enable casting mode, shift-right click the wand. Shift right-clicking also takes you out of casting mode. You can open the focus pouch to the wand using shift-left click to change what focus your wand is using (more on this later). You will start out with no foci.

Focuses are what enable you to use different spells with the wand. There are currently 3 different foci (not included the 'No Focus'):
Fire Focus - 2 spells: right click block to spawn lava source, right click in a general area to burn all living entities within a radius.
Ice Focus - 1 spell: right click near or on water to turn all water blocks near that source block (4x4 grid) into ice. 
Ender Focus - 1 spell: right click open area to teleport to it.

These spells each cost 100 mana.

To obtain the foci, you must craft them. Below are the three recipes:

Ender Focus: http://imgur.com/OdxTm49

It is noted the recipes are nearly identical, except for the top and bottom-center item.
Once crafting a focus, shift-right click it to add it to your focus pouch. Opening your focus pouch will now show the updated foc(i/us).
To select a focus, left or right click it in the GUI.

Mana is a limiting factor in this mod. Mana is represented in casting mode by the 2-9th hotbar slots when in casting mode. The potions will show the percentage where a full potion means that section (1/8th) is full, a lingering potion means that half section (1/16th) is full, and an empty potion shows the section is empty. You also see your mana by the name display on your wand when casting.
